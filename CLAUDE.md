# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript/Node.js project for testing Claude's GitHub integration capabilities. It creates a simple HTTP server that serves an HTML page with a "Hello World" dialog.

## Build and Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript and copy HTML to dist
npm run build

# Run the compiled application
npm start

# Build and run in one step (development)
npm run dev
```

The application starts an HTTP server on port 3000. Access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Architecture

### Source Structure
- **src/index.ts** - Main entry point. Creates an HTTP server that:
  - Serves `index.html` on all routes
  - Uses ES modules with `import.meta.url` for path resolution
  - Listens on port 3000
- **src/index.html** - Static HTML page served by the server

### Build Output
- **dist/** - Compiled JavaScript output (generated by TypeScript compiler)
- Build process copies both compiled JS and HTML files to `dist/`

### TypeScript Configuration
The project uses strict TypeScript settings:
- Target: `esnext` with `nodenext` module resolution
- Source: `./src`, Output: `./dist`
- Strict mode enabled with additional checks:
  - `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
  - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
- Generates source maps and declaration files

## GitHub Integration

### Claude Workflows
The repository has two GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **.github/workflows/claude.yml** - Triggers when:
   - Comments containing `@claude` are posted on issues or PRs
   - Issues are opened/assigned with `@claude` in title or body
   - PR reviews are submitted with `@claude` in body

2. **.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml** - Automatic review workflow:
   - Runs on PR open/update
   - Reviews code quality, bugs, performance, security, and test coverage
   - Posts feedback using `gh pr comment`
   - Uses repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance

Both workflows require `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret to be configured.

## Code Style

- Console messages are in Italian (matching existing pattern)
- ES modules pattern with `import.meta.url` for file path resolution
- Async/await for file operations
- Error handling with try/catch blocks
